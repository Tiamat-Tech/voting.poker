## Data Collection and Analysis Advisory

The Next.js client uses [OpenReplay](https://www.openreplay.com/) for user interaction analysis, that will record sessions from those who allow the usage of cookies. The data collected is used to improve the user experience and the project itself.

If you don't want to be tracked, you can disable cookies on your browser or if you have already accepted the cookies, you can clear them on your browser settings.

In case you still wanna remove your data from OpenReplay, you can contact me at [jeffersonmourak@gmail.com](mailto:jeffersonmourak@gmail.com) and I can find and delete your data from OpenReplay records.

**For transparency here are the data collected.**

- Session Recording.
- Network requests that were originated from <https://voting.poker> domain.
- User interactions with the website.
- User identification (email, avatar, name, browser, and device information).
- IP location (City and Country only)

**Why am I using OpenReplay?**

- To improve the user experience.
- To understand how users are interacting with the website.
- To find and fix bugs the project is solo and I can't test everything (Yes I do look at the recordings).
- Because it's open source like this project.

**Why am I telling you this?**

- Because I care about your privacy.
- Because I want to be transparent about the data collected.
- Because I want to give you the option to opt-out.
- Because I want to give your opinion about the collection and how we can improve it together.
