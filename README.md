## DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS ADVISORY
We've recently added [Fullstory](https://www.fullstory.com/) as a data collection and analysis tool.
This is being used to increase the quality of the tool and to improve the user experience, however, we are not collecting any personal data.
In the mean while, we're looking for a solution to release all data to the public, in a good way, so everyone can look what we're collecing and how it's being used.
